# DevOps In Real Life

## What is this all about?

The goal here is to help you fill the gap between what you may have learned in college, youtube, etc. and real life tasks & scenarios I've experienced in my day to day job as a DevOps Engineer. By doing so, hopefully you'll build the necessary experience and confidence to make the jump into a DevOps career.


## How are we going to do it?

We are not here to learn everything from scratch, as it was stated before, the goal here is to help you get experience by doing real life DevOps tasks. 
You will still have to do the heavy lifting on the learning side, that involves taking the time to learn any fundamental skill that it might be required (Linux, AWS, etc) by yourselves. 
Having said that, I'll try to maintain a curated list of resources that will help you to build that foundational knowledge.
